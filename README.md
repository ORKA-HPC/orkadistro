# Docker-based build environment and runtime for ORKA-HPC

## Build environment requirements

- A GNU/Linux distribution with a recent kernel (>= 5, problems have been reported on 3.x).
- Docker v19.0 or higher
- Optional: You need a research license for the EDG C++ frontend
  1. Contact `info@edg.com`
  2. Write that you need access to the EDG C++ frontend
     sources. To make things as smooth as possible for you,
     you should put me (`florian.andrefranc.mayer@fau.de`) on CC.
     Tell them that you need a research license for EDG in order
     to compile the ROSE toolchain from the sources. State that
     ORKA-HPC is using a custom ROSE fork that won't work with
     the pre-built EDG binaries from the standard ROSE distribution.
  3. Once you got it, mail the license to me.
  4. I will then give you access to a private
     repository containing ROSE's custom EDG sources.

## Getting Started

### Building the ORKA-HPC

To initialize ORKA-HPC, use: 
`[ CLEAN_BUILD=1 ] [ NO_EDG_REPO=1 ] ./setup.sh [ --init | --clean-after-pull | --after-pull ]`

You can build the ORKA-HPC development environment with or without
a EDG research license. When the environment variable
`NO_EDG_REPO=1` is present, `setup.sh` will not try to
use the EDG sources. Instead it will download a pre-built
package of EDG binaries during the build process.
In the following examples, `[ VAR=1 ] ./setup.sh ...` means
that the variable assignment `VAR=1` is optional.
See section `Frequent Issues` if `setup.sh` fails.

- `--init` builds the ORKA-HPC Docker image, creates
  an initial container, and volume-mounts most of the submodules in
  this repo. It builds the sources in these submodules
  **inside** the Docker container, creates Debian packages for
  each submodule, and installs them **inside** the container.

- `--after-pull` rebuilds the docker container (which is
  necessary after a pull of orkadistro.
  It tries to reuse previously compiled code.
  Docker, by default, will try to re-use those commands
  in the Dockerfile that have not changed between commits.
  However, due to that caching, sometimes inconsistencies sneak in.
  If you encounter strange errors later on,
- try to use `--clean-after-pull`.

### Operate ORKA-HPC

The following commands assume that you pulled orkadistro and
executed `setup.sh --init`.

- `./run_docker.sh -r` tries to create a Docker container,
  to establish volume mounts, and to launch the container in the background.
  If a ORKA-HPC Docker container happens to be present it will be woken up.

- `./run_docker.sh -e` opens a shell in the
  ORKA-HPC Docker container ready for developer interaction.

- `./run_docker.sh -q` stops the container. The container is
  basically suspended and can be woken up with `-r`.

- `./run_docker.sh --stop-and-remove` stops and removes the
  running container. All your data in the container is
  erased that way.

### Notes

`rebuild_docker.sh` builds a docker image with the
following name: `orkadistro-img-<git-ref>`, where git-ref
is the git commit hash of this repository. This ensures
that you can test and run different Docker images.

`run_docker.sh` starts a docker container with the
following name: `orkadistro-cont-<sha256-hash>`, where
sha256-hash is generated by hashing the content of 
`$PWD`. This ensures that doing

```bash
( git clone <orkadistro-uri> orkadistro && cd orkadistroA \
  && ./setup.sh --init && ./run_docker -r -e -q )
( git clone <orkadistro-uri> orkadistro && cd orkadistroB \
  && ./setup.sh --init && ./run_docker -r -e -q )
```

gives you access to two _different_ instances of the
same images!

## Frequent Issues

- docker permission issues:
    - `sudo groupadd docker`
    - `sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}`
    - `sudo service docker restart`
    - Log out and back in.

- You need to run `run_docker.sh --stop-and-unmount` before
  you can `./rebuild.sh` the image again.
